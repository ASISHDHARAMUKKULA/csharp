var does not allow the type of value assigned to be changed after it is assigned to. 
This means that if we assign an integer value to a var then we cannot assign a string value to it. 
This is because, on assigning the integer value, it will be treated as an integer type thereafter. 
So thereafter no other type of value cannot be assigned. For example, the following code will give a compile time error:


dynamic allows the type of value to change after it is assigned to initially. In the code above, if we use dynamic instead of var, it will not only compile, but will also work at run-time. 
This is because, at run time, the value of the variable is first inferred as Int32 and when its value is changed, it is inferred to be a string type.
